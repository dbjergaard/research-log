* About the Author
I'm a PhD. candidate at Duke university.  When I'm not working hard
to understand the experimental subtleties of measuring properties of
Quantum Chromodynamics, I can be found:
- Maintaining [[https://github.com/stumpwm/stumpwm][StumpWM]], a tiling window manager written in Common Lisp 
- Hacking on various personal [[https://github.com/dbjergaard?tab%3Drepositories][software projects]]
- Extending and Hacking Emacs
- Reading anything I can get my hands on, recently though:
  - Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
  - Count of Monte Cristo - Alexander Dumas
  - Moonstone - Wilkie Collins  
  - Cloud Atlas - David Mitchell
- Brewing Beer, I've made:
  - Patersbier
  - Raspberry wheat beer
  - Northern Brewer's Caribou Slobber
- Taking Photographs

I care deeply about communicating my work clearly, concisely and with
good design. To that end I've been significantly influenced by:
- [[http://practicaltypography.com/][Butterick's Practical Typography]]
- The Visual Display of Quantitative Information - Edward Tufte
