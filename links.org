# * ROOTisms
# ROOT is a monolithic, multifunctional, multi-faceted analysis
# framework written by Physicist-hackers.  It is an shining example of
# real-world software design, and it has grown up over many major
# experiments in HEP.  

# Its great because its the only show in town.  There are plenty of
# other open source tools which serve similar purposes, but none provide
# a uniform interface to tackle all of the day to day tasks of a HEP
# physicist.

# What I'm trying to get at is that I have a deep respect for the
# software, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have subtle idiosyncrasies
# that will jump out and bite you when you least expect it.

# PS. It seems that the ROOT developers feel my pain as well, but the
# counter argument for change is backwards compatibility: [[http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/root6-and-backward-compatibility][ROOT 6
# backwards compatability]]. 

# Do you have one? Email me and I'll include it.  This is done in the
# style of the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unix-Haters_Handbook][Unix Hater's handbook]].
